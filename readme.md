## **1. Prepare to use fish shell**
### **1.1 Install WSL** (For Windows only)
If you want to use Fish Shell on Windows, you have to install [WSL](https://github.com/chinhchin/WSL-setup.git) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) for running Linux on Windows.

> **Note**
>
> In every command next from this, type every command into WSL.

### **1.2 Install Nerd Font**
First, I have to install Nerd Fonts so that I can display the icons and markers used in programming nicely.

So I use [Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/CascadiaCode.zip).
